                    Hi, I'm David - a technology explorer who turns curiosity into action. I'm not a traditional technical expert; instead, I'm the colleague who sees new tools and thinks "let's figure this out together." I love making complex technologies accessible and turning ideas into working experiments.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    I'm passionate about diving into cutting-edge tools that might seem complex at first, but hold incredible potential once you understand how they work. I'm not afraid of tackling challenging platforms - I enjoy making them work for practical purposes.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    <strong>Perfect for colleagues who:</strong> Have ideas but think the technology might be too complex, want to explore new possibilities without getting lost in technical details, or need someone who's willing to learn and experiment alongside them.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Whether you want to turn "this looks complicated" into "let's figure it out together," or simply share the excitement of making something work - let's explore what we can discover and build.

            <p class="description">
                I believe in the power of experimentation and the courage to explore uncharted territories. My journey isn't about delivering perfect enterprise solutions—it's about discovering what's possible, one experiment at a time.

                    <p>I specialize in rapid POCs and MVPs that provide clear evidence of viability before major investments.</p>
                    <p>It's about validating concepts quickly and efficiently, turning "what if" into "here's how."</p>
